The AV Club found themselves deep in the Thieves’ Guild, with Uda bound in her chair, unconscious. With no time to waste, they left a note asking for her cooperation and a way to meet them in secret, then slipped into the night and back to the [[Fleabag Inn]] for much-needed rest.

The next morning, they regrouped at the [[Prancing Pony]], where Romark convinced the halfling bartender, Dorian, to alert them if anyone asked for their coded drink, the "White Russian." Sorting through intel from Uda’s office, they uncovered a list of targets—some already marked off—which raised concerns about the cult’s infiltration.

Seeking guidance, they went to the Temple of Lathander, where Romark sought absolution from High Mornmaster Darn. During the ritual, Romark had a vision of a shadowy, storm-filled figure with glowing eyes—a terrifying glimpse into the presence behind his cursed amulet—only to be saved by a piercing light. Shaken but resolved, Romark shared the amulet with Darn, who informed them that [[Loraen Silverblade]], a key figure they sought, had mysteriously left [[Waterdeep]] days before. Romark also learned that his home had been destroyed, with no survivors reported.

Still tracking cult activity, they headed to the Merchants’ Guild to find Olarus Flint. Sayah, posing as a guild member, slipped inside with Tyr as her “bodyguard.” But once inside, they stumbled upon a gruesome scene in Flint's office—a body slumped over a desk. Guards raised the alarm, and panic erupted as they tried to make their escape.

Merla and Romark, waiting outside, created a riot to help Sayah and Tyr escape the guild hall. In the chaos, Merla enlarged Tyr, who barreled through the crowd and guards. Amidst the frenzy, the party managed to slip away, but their identities as agitators were noted by the guards.

Returning to the Tower of Arcanum, the party sought counsel from [[Sage Aronthal]], who revealed that the cult’s targets were [[Waterdeep]]’s council members and explained that Romark’s amulet was a powerful cult relic. The party were concered with his own safety as his name appeared on the list, but he reassured them that he could take care of himself. He gave them one last lead: Stone Forge.

Finally, they decided to check on the Grey Guard’s leader, the last name on the hit list. But as they approached the heavily guarded castle, an injured guard from the Merchants' Guild recognized them. With a shout, the alarm was raised, and the group bolted. Amid the chaos, everyone managed to escape—except Wisp, who was left behind in the throngs of pursuing guards.

The AV Club now stands on the edge of conflict, with the cult’s insidious influence seeming to reach every corner of [[Waterdeep]].
