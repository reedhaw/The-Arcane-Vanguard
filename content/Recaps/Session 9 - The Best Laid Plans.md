The AV Club finds themselves fractured and anxious amid the bustling city of [[Waterdeep]]. With Wisp missing and presumed captured, and Merla separated during their escape, Tyr, Romark, and Sayah retreat to the relative safety of the [[Fleabag Inn]]. Uncertainty weighs heavily as they wait out the flurry of Grey Guard patrols scouring the streets.

Merla, trailing behind after casting _Invisibility_ to evade capture, seeks refuge at the [[Prancing Pony]]. Quickly realizing she’s alone, she sets out for the [[Fleabag Inn]]. Along the way, she notices a cloaked figure shadowing her. Undeterred, she pushes onward, eventually reuniting with her companions. Relaying her suspicions about being followed, the group grows uneasy but resolves to press forward.

Upstairs in Romark's rented room, the party debates their next move, peering cautiously out the window for an escape route. The drop appears too perilous. Sayah steps outside to survey their surroundings, but finding no immediate threats, the group steels themselves for the task ahead: rescuing Wisp, who they believe languishes in the custody of the Grey Guard.

Meanwhile, Wisp finds himself locked in a grimy cell deep within the dungeons of [[Mount Waterdeep]]. The small, dank chamber offers little solace—a pile of hay for a bed and a bucket of foul-smelling waste. Ever the provocateur, Wisp calls over a guard and, in a moment of impish rebellion, flings the contents of the bucket squarely into the man’s face. Enraged, the guard swings at him with the butt of his spear but misses, retreating in humiliation to clean up.

Back on the streets, Merla, Sayah, Tyr, and Romark tail a Grey Guard patrol in hopes of gleaning useful information. While Sayah stealthily eavesdrops, Merla suddenly succumbs to a surge of wild magic, becoming disoriented and aggressive. Without warning, she turns on Romark, swinging wildly but missing. Tyr leaps into action, pinning her until the chaotic spell subsides. Sayah returns shortly after, empty-handed and frustrated.

Desperation calls for bold action. The group devises a plan to acquire Grey Guard uniforms. Their initial attempt—a poorly staged scene by Tyr and Romark—falls flat, but Merla’s quick thinking and mischievous wit save the day. She humiliates one of the guards by yanking down his trousers, then lures him into an alley where the party subdues him. Reluctant but overpowered, the guard strips off his uniform in exchange for a hefty bribe from Romark before fleeing into the night.

Disguised as a guard, Romark leads the party to [[Mount Waterdeep]] in search of Wisp. Unknown to them, Wisp had already been released the previous evening. However, his freedom is not without complication, as two Grey Guards quietly shadow him through the city. Undeterred, Wisp makes his way back to the [[Fleabag Inn]], where he spends the night in solitude.

Romark, Merla, and Tyr infiltrate the dungeon disguised as drunkards and are promptly directed to the drunk tank. Romark, ever resourceful, deviates from the plan and attempts to sneak deeper into the dungeon. He encounters a guard who blocks his way but manages to glimpse the logbook, which reveals that Wisp was released the day prior. With their search in vain, Tyr and Merla resign themselves to a night in the drunk tank while Romark retreats to regroup.

The following morning, Romark collects Tyr and Merla, and the trio returns with Sayah to the [[Fleabag Inn]]. To their shock and relief, they find Wisp seated in a shadowy corner of the tavern, calmly eating a bowl of gruel as though nothing had happened. Reunited once again, the AV Club prepares to tackle whatever chaos comes next.
