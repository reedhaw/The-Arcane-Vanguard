The AV Club descended into the sewers of [[Waterdeep]], finding themselves in a dark, damp, and foul-smelling labyrinth. As they trudged through the muck, Tyr suddenly felt a sharp sting on his feet. What they had mistaken for slick stones revealed itself to be a grey ooze, an amorphous blob that began to corrode his armor. With the party still wounded from their last encounter, they retreated, with some members defending the rear of the party. With a final swing, Tyr hurled a hand axe into the ooze, delivering a decisive blow that ended the creature’s assault.

Pressing forward, they eventually reached a narrow tunnel that led to a dead end. At the center of the wall, they found four small keyholes, with a skeleton slumped at the base, clutching a set of keys. Four plaques adorned the adjacent wall, each bearing a symbol and a phrase—clearly a puzzle blocking the entrance to the Thieves’ Guild Hall.

Wisp, using his quick thinking, summoned his unique spell, _Unseen Pork Boi_, to manipulate the keys from a distance. The first attempt triggered a trap, releasing a cloud of toxic gas into the tunnel. After a moment of tension, the second try proved successful, and the wall swung open silently, revealing a latrine on the other side.

Realizing they had entered the heart of the Thieves’ Guild, Sayah quietly scouted ahead. Sneaking through the halls, she reached the main mess area where two figures spotted her. Strangely, they chose not to interfere, allowing her to pass without incident. She slipped deeper into the guild, eventually making her way to the Guild Master’s office.

Inside, Uda was slumped over her desk, her condition uncertain. In the corner, Sayah noticed a heavy chest, clearly rigged with two traps—a pressure plate beneath and another mechanism inside the chest. She tried to disarm the trap, but her efforts went awry. Twin blades shot out from the chest, slashing into her before retracting as the lid slammed shut.

The noise startled Uda awake, her eyes narrowing as she recognized Sayah. "You. Brave of you to return," Uda growled, drawing her sword. Sayah called out for help, and the rest of the party arrived just in time.

A fierce battle erupted, but despite Uda's strength, the group managed to knock her unconscious and bind her to the chair. With Uda subdued, the party scoured her office, uncovering a hidden compartment and several clues that hinted at the Thieves’ Guild’s ties to the cult they had been chasing.

Now, with Uda captured and new information in hand, the party finds themselves one step closer to uncovering the cult's dark plans.
