The session begins with the party returning from the ambush they had just foiled and informing Wisp of their success. As evening falls, the group heads to the tavern to rest. Inside, they find the bar already being repaired and meet Berilac, the mayor of [[Secomber]]. He thanks them for their help but seems preoccupied. Upon questioning, Berilac reveals that the [[Netheril|Netherese Empire]] is at war with the Phaerimm, a type of magical aberration once thought to be a legend. Concerned about the town's future, he persuades the party to stay another night, offering a pair of workhorses as compensation.

The night passes without incident. The next morning, while the party is having breakfast at the tavern, a tall, dark figure enters, accompanied by two strange, hairless dogs with pointed ears and arrow-tipped tails. The townspeople, including Nala, are visibly fearful of this man. He reveals himself as the leader of the bandits terrorizing the village and is unhappy that the party has disrupted his plans.

Tensions quickly escalate, leading to a fight. With Nala’s help, the party defeats the mysterious figure, though it is a challenging battle. Afterward, Tyr finds a mysterious object and some gold on the defeated leader, which he shares with the group. The mayor, Berilac, returns, relieved to learn that the bandit leader, Eoran, has been defeated, giving the town hope for recovery. Nala nervously asks if she can join the party on their journey to [[Waterdeep]], and they agree.

The group decides to stay another day in Secomber to rest and gather supplies. They spend the day shopping for trinkets and potions. That evening, during celebrations, a drunk local asks for the group’s name. After some discussion, they decide to call themselves "The Arcane Vanguard," or the AV Club.

The next morning, the AV Club sets out for Waterdeep and reaches Daggerford, a military encampment about a day’s ride from their destination. Here, they witness the assembling forces of [[Netheril]], clad in burgundy and white, with pennants flying and fortifications being constructed. A column of about 2,000 soldiers, archers, mages, and other units arrives. At the head of this column is a tall, lithe automaton, an unfamiliar sight to the party. As it marches past, the automaton’s eyes momentarily fix on the party, scanning them, though its head remains facing forward. The group watches in awe as the column continues its march.
