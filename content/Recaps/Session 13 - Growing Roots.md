Exhausted but victorious, the Arcane Vanguard settled into their new home—Kaerndal Keep. As they recovered from recent trials, from saving [[Redwater]] from a mysterious illness to days spent fishing in the nearby forests, they turned their focus to making the keep their own. Yet, even in newfound refuge, the world outside still loomed large. Seeking answers, they reached out to S.C.A.R.A., the Netherese General, hoping for guidance.

The response was swift but cryptic. Davron, one of S.C.A.R.A.'s lieutenants, answered Sayah’s Sending, but offered little information—only a basic question: "Where are you?" but was cut short. Unwilling to wait for more uncertainty, the group set their sights on a new goal: tracking down Silverblade, one of the remaining targets on the cultists’ list, and unraveling the deeper mystery at play.

Just as they prepared to leave, an unexpected visitor arrived at their gates—a wandering knight seeking lodging for the night. Suspicious but intrigued, they questioned him, learning little new, but managed to persuade him to stay on as a Bastion Defender for the keep. With their home newly fortified, they ventured into the wilderness.

The journey through the rolling foothills of the Sword Mountains was uneventful—until nightfall. As the party rested, Romark took watch, his fingers idly turning over the mysterious deck of cards he had found days before. It was only then that realization struck—this was a Deck of Many Things. Without much hesitation, he drew.

The first card: The Rogue. An image of a shadowy figure sneaking through the night. The card vanished in a flash of fire and smoke, slipping back into the deck.

The second: The Knight. A warrior, arm raised in defiance, astride a mighty steed. As the card disappeared in the same fiery burst, the sound of hooves echoed behind Romark.

Turning, he found himself face to face with a mounted warrior, who dismounted with solemn purpose. Without hesitation, the knight knelt before Romark and offered up his sword.

The rest of the party bolted awake, weapons at the ready. Romark, cautious but resolute, reached out and accepted the knight’s blade. The warrior rose and pledged himself to the paladin’s service.

Though questions swirled, the knight offered no real answers—only unwavering loyalty. Seeing an opportunity, the party sent their newfound ally on a quest to Amphail, supplying him with gold and orders to procure three horses to quicken their travels.

As the knight departed, the Arcane Vanguard pressed onward, deeper into the wilds, chasing the unknown.
