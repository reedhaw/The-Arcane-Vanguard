## Overview
Sage Aronthal is a learned individual residing in the city of Waterdeep1 He is associated with the Tower of Arcanum, a public library containing vast collections of tomes and scrolls.

The Arcane Vanguard (AV Club) sought counsel from Sage Aronthal at the Tower of Arcanum. They were tracking cult activity in Waterdeep and were seeking information and guidance. Aronthal revealed to the party that the cult's targets included members of Waterdeep's High Council. He also identified Romark's amulet as a powerful relic of the cult, identifying high ranking members.

Aronthal was on the cult's list of targets, but he assured the AV Club that he could protect himself1. Before the AV Club left, he directed them to Stoneforge as a potential lead.

The Tower of Arcanum is open to the public, unlike other libraries in the city that are restricted to universities and academies. The library is vast and contains shelves filled with ancient books and scrolls. An elderly elf sits at a desk in the center of the library, diligently transcribing arcane texts. He offers assistance when asked.

Aronthal's knowledge and guidance proved valuable to the Arcane Vanguard as they navigated the complexities of Waterdeep and investigated the cult's activities. He appears to be a significant resource for those seeking knowledge about arcane matters and the history of Waterdeep.
