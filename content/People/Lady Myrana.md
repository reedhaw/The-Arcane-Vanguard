## **Overview**
Lady Myrana was a powerful and enigmatic figure who ruled over a **serene keep surrounded by wildflower fields**—a deceptive oasis masking the **wrath of Talos.** Appearing as a striking woman with **deep black skin, graying curls streaked with electric blue, and eyes crackling with stormlight,** she concealed her **true nature as a blue dragon** and a **chosen servant of Talos, the god of storms and destruction.**

Myrana’s keep served as a haven for her followers, who revered her as a near-divine protector. Beneath her **calm and regal demeanor** lay a deep, unwavering faith in Talos, and an absolute **conviction that only his dominion could prepare the world for the storms to come.**

## **Encounter with the Arcane Vanguard**
Myrana welcomed the **Arcane Vanguard** into her keep, offering them rest but **speaking with an ominous weight** in her words. She privately **counseled Sayah and Romark,** delivering cryptic warnings and gauging their loyalties.

When **pressed by Romark,** Myrana revealed a **terrifying vision:**

- A **floating city** adrift in the sky.
- A **shimmering sea** stretching endlessly below.
- A **robed man called Karsus,** standing on the precipice of creation.

She warned that **Karsus’ creation** held the power to **end the weave.**

She **demanded that Romark renounce his faiths** and **swear fealty to the Storm Lord**—or face annihilation.

When the party refused, Myrana revealed her **true form, transforming into a mighty blue dragon** and calling upon **Talos’ fury.**

## **The Battle at the Keep**
The ensuing battle was **ferocious and devastating.** Myrana wielded her **silver staff, crackling with divine lightning,** and **summoned the storm itself** to strike down her foes. Thunder roared through the keep as the **Arcane Vanguard struggled against her immense power.**

Despite her overwhelming might, the party **stood firm**. In a climactic clash, they **brought down the Storm Herald.**

## **Aftermath**
With Myrana slain, **the people of the keep emerged, stunned** by the revelation that their leader had been a dragon all along. They **witnessed Romark denounce Talos** as a false god and **proclaim Lathander’s light.** Some of Myrana’s followers, shaken by the truth, **knelt before him in reverence.**

Tyr, ever the opportunist, **harvested materials from Myrana’s fallen form**—a reminder of the dragon’s might and the party’s victory.
