**Affiliation:** [[Netheril]]
**Status:** Active

---
## **Overview**
General S.C.A.R.A. is an ancient **Netherese war construct**, a high-ranking figure of the **[[Netheril]].** Unlike mindless automatons, S.C.A.R.A. exhibits **high intelligence, tactical acumen, and advanced psionic abilities.** He has demonstrated knowledge of individuals and events in the **Sword Coast** and is capable of **reading minds**, which he used to learn about Romark’s past.

S.C.A.R.A. first encountered the Arcane Vanguard at a **Netherese military encampment near [[Daggerford]],** where he interrogated Wisp and probed Romark’s mind. Rather than execute them as potential threats, he extended an offer: **aid the Netherese in dismantling a dangerous cult terrorizing the Sword Coast**—or face death.

## **Mission and Incentives**
In exchange for their cooperation, S.C.A.R.A. provided:

- **10 platinum coins and a health potion** to each member.
- **Transport to [[Waterdeep]]** to pursue leads on the cult.
- **One half of a pair of sending stones** for future communication.

During their meeting, S.C.A.R.A. revealed that Romark’s **amulet bore the mark of Talos,** identifying him as someone of high rank within the cult. This revelation suggested the amulet could be key to **infiltrating the cult’s inner circles.**

## **Forces & Presence**
S.C.A.R.A.’s troops, loyal and well-coordinated, patrol and search areas of interest. At the **[[Daggerford]] encampment**, his forces were actively hunting for intruders when Wisp was captured. Though their full capabilities remain unknown, their efficiency suggests a well-maintained military structure.
