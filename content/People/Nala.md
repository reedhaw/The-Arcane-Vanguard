## Overview
Nala is a young, charismatic and outgoing bard of draconic origins. First found in the [[Twilight Tavern]] in [[Secomber]], she quickly eyes up the party and introduces them into a fight - and threw the AV Club into a mission to liberate the small town.

With her help, the party eventually overthrew the bandits, who had mysterious ties to the Cult in [[Waterdeep]]. Joining them, Nala departs with the party and heads towards [[Daggerford]] and eventually [[Waterdeep]]. 

In [[Daggerford]] she spends the night playing music to soldiers and earning her stay, avoiding many of the issues the AV Club came across. Once she gets to [[Waterdeep]] she goes off on her own to discover and start her story. 

## Appearance
Nala is a young dragonborn female. She has vibrant blue scales with silvered horns that curl up behind her head. She wears simple clothes of a worn traveller style.
