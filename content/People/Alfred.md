## Overview
Not much is known of Alfred, other than he appeared in the middle of the night when Romark drew the Knight Card from the Deck of Many Things. Astride a horse, he immediately dismounted and offered up his sword to Romark - pledging himself to him. 

## Appearance
Alfred - if that is his name - appears to be a fighter. Adorned with leather armour, a silver and an iron sword, and a steed named Roach, Alfred is as mysterious as his appearance. Around 50 years of age with shoulder length salt and pepper hair and a long beard, his rough and grizzled appearance indicates a hard life. One that he's not willing to share.
